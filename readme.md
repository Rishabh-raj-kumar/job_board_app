## Overview

This project appears to be a **Job Portal** likely created as part of a YouTube tutorial series or as a demonstration of web development skills. It probably showcases how to build a platform where users can post and apply for jobs.

**Note:** As there is no README in the repository currently, this description is based on the repository name. More details about the project's specific features and technologies used will be added once the repository is updated or more information is available.

## Key Features (Expected)

Based on the name, the project likely includes features such as:

* **Job Posting:** Ability for users (likely employers) to create and publish job listings.
* **Job Searching:** Functionality for users (job seekers) to search and browse available jobs based on keywords, location, category, etc.
* **User Authentication:** Registration and login for both employers and job seekers.
* **Profile Management:** Ability for users to create and manage their profiles.
* **Application Process:** Functionality for job seekers to apply for jobs.
* **Admin Panel (Potentially):** An interface for administrators to manage the platform.

**More features will be listed here once the project details are clearer.**

## Getting Started (Expected)

These are general instructions. Specific steps might vary depending on the technologies used.

### Prerequisites (Expected)

* **Node.js and npm:** If it's a JavaScript-based project (likely for a modern web application).
* **Database:** A database system like MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL (depending on the project's stack).
* **Web Browser:** For viewing the application.

3.  **Set up the database:**
    * Install the required database system (if not already installed).
    * Create a database for the project.
    * Configure the database connection details (likely in a configuration file or environment variables).
    * Run migrations or seed the database if necessary.
4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    * Look for a `.env.example` file (or similar) and create a `.env` file with your specific configurations (database credentials, API keys, etc.).

### Running the Application (Expected)

If it's a Node.js based project:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
# or potentially a development server command like:
npm run dev
yarn run dev
